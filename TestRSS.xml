      <title>The Vulkan website has a new home and look!</title>
<link>https://www.opengl.org/news/comments/the&#45;vulkan&#45;website&#45;has&#45;a&#45;new&#45;home&#45;and&#45;look</link>
      <description>It has been a while in the making but we are very excited to launch the new Vulkan website to the community. Don’t worry, Vulkan is still maintained and owned by The Khronos Group; we just felt that it had outgrown its old website now that it has been five years since the Vulkan 1.0 launch.

The original Vulkan website was designed for the launch of a cutting edge new API that would, initially, have limited official materials and community content. The old website performed that role admirably, but Vulkan has come a long way and we now have a large and increasing amount of tools, libraries, educational material, and news to showcase that a single page website cannot handle. The new website allows us to gather all these currently disparate internal and community resources in a single, easily navigable place.

Our primary goal with the new vulkan.org site was to place key resources prominently to allow developers to quickly and easily find what they need. With this in mind, each page has buttons in the banner leading straight to the most essential and popular resources. If you need the Vulkan Specification, SDK or Guide you can just jump straight there, no digging needed.

The new site has a whole page dedicated to Vulkan tools and support, giving developers access to SDKs, profilers, debuggers, libraries, language bindings, game engines and frameworks all easy to navigate to through a series of quick buttons. This is a huge improvement and it let’s developers discover new tools or quickly find their go to favorites.

Vulkan is enjoying a boom in adoption by world class developers and we want to make sure we are showcasing this exciting content to our visitors. As such you’ll notice much more prominent use of imagery across the site that will be updated as time goes on and new content is available. There is also now a dedicated “Made with Vulkan” showcase which is a living list of Vulkan content and reveals just how powerful and versatile the API is. If you have a Vulkan project that you would like to let us know about, please use the linked form on the Made with Vulkan page above the showcase.

We hope this website becomes a new focal point for the Vulkan community and improves the Vulkan development experience for both new and experienced developers.</description>

      <title>NVIDIA provides OpenGL&#45;accelerated Remote Desktop for GeForce</title>
<link>https://www.opengl.org/news/comments/nvidia&#45;provides&#45;opengl&#45;accelerated&#45;remote&#45;desktop&#45;for&#45;geforce</link>
      <description>In these days of social distancing, game developers and content creators all over the world are working from home and asking for help using Windows Remote Desktop streaming with the OpenGL tools they use. NVIDIA has created a special tool for GeForce GPUs to accelerate Windows Remote Desktop streaming with GeForce drivers R440 or later. Download and run the executable (nvidiaopenglrdp.exe) from the DesignWorks website as Administrator on the remote Windows PC where your OpenGL application will run. A dialog will confirm that OpenGL acceleration is enabled for Remote Desktop and if a reboot is required.</description>

      <title>Khronos Group Releases Vulkan 1.2</title>
<link>https://www.opengl.org/news/comments/khronos&#45;group&#45;releases&#45;vulkan&#45;1.2</link>
      <description>The Khronos Group announces the release of the Vulkan 1.2 specification for GPU acceleration. This release integrates 23 proven extensions into the core Vulkan API, bringing significant developer&#45;requested access to new hardware functionality, improved application performance, and enhanced API usability. Multiple GPU vendors have certified conformant implementations, and significant open source tooling is expected during January 2020. Vulkan continues to evolve by listening to developer needs, shipping new functionality as extensions, and then consolidating extensions that receive positive developer feedback into a unified core API specification. Khronos and the Vulkan community will support Vulkan 1.2 in a wide range of open source compilers, tools, and debuggers by the end of January 2020. Driver release updates will be posted on the Vulkan Public Release Tracker.

      <description>If you are attending GDC 2019, be sure to mark March 19th in your calendar. Khronos will be hosting the annual Developer Day sessions in the Moscone West, Room 2020 from 10am to 6:30PM. This year there will be six (6) sessions covering glTF, WebGL, OpenXR, Vulkan and OpenGL ES. There will also be an OpenXR table at VRDC where you can learn more about OpenXR, talk with OpenXR working group members, and learn how your company can implement or join in the development of this important industry standard. The Khronos Group is once again sponsoring the WebGL/WebVR Meetup. Last year we had over 200 RSVPs and an amazing lineup of speakers.</description>
